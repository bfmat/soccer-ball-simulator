# Soccer Ball Simulator
This game, for PC, Mac, and Linux, is a 100% accurate simulation of a jumping soccer ball on moving, rotating, exploding platforms in the sky. It was one of my first major projects with Unity, developed in the spring and summer of 2016. It was never completed, but it is certainly playable.

Levels are procedurally generated, with parameters varying depending on the selected difficulty. They include moving and rotating platforms, gravity blocks, coins for the player to collect, disappearing blocks, flying pigs, and a variety of power-ups that change the player's appearance and give them different movement mechanics. For the sake of Super Meat Boy-inspired difficulty, there are no checkpoints. This can be more than a challenge, especially at the "Slightly Over the Top" difficulty level.

## Disclaimer
My goal is for this game to be fun and difficult. Unfortunately, despite its noble goal of a rewarding challenge, the procedural generator may create impossible levels, especially at the higher difficulty levels. Don't be too upset; I can't beat many of them either.
